## Project description
This project is a diary application developed as part of the portfolio assignment in **IDATT1003 – Programming 1** at NTNU.
The application allows users to create, view, search, and delete diary entries. It supports multiple authors, search ranged by the latest post, searching based on keywords, and generating statistics showing the number of diary entries per author. 

### The solution includes:

- A text-based user interface

- Core entity classes (DiaryEntry, Author)

- Registers for storing entries and authors

- Exception handling and validation

- Sorting and filtering functionality

- Logging using Java’s built-in logging framework

This project satisfies the functional requirements for both **Level 1** and **Level 2** described in the assignment.
